# ðŸ§ª Workflow Testing

This file is created to test the automatic issue completion workflow.

## Test Details

- **Test Branch**: `feature/DEVFLOW-17-test-completion`
- **Expected Behavior**: Issue #17 should be automatically closed when this PR is merged
- **Workflow File**: `.github/workflows/auto-issue-completion.yml`

- [x] File changes made
- [ ] PR created

The workflow should generate a standardized completion comment with:
