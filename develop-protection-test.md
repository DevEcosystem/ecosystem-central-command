# Develop Branch Protection Test

This file tests whether the `develop` branch is properly protected from automatic deletion.

**Critical Test:**
- Branch: `develop` (protected branch)
- Expected: Should NOT be deleted after PR merge
- Protection: "Restrict deletions" enabled
- Alert: If deleted, this indicates branch protection bypass

**Test Scenario:**
1. Add this file to develop branch ✅
2. Create PR: develop → main
3. Merge PR
4. Check if develop branch still exists
5. Monitor for deletion alerts

**This test will reveal if there's a branch protection configuration issue.**
