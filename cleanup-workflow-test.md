# Cleanup Workflow Test

**Testing the new automated branch cleanup system.**

**Workflow Features:**
- ✅ Auto-delete merged branches after PR merge
- ✅ Protected branch safeguards (main, develop, staging)
- ✅ Manual cleanup option with dry-run mode
- ✅ Never deletes protected branches

**This Test:**
- Branch: `test-cleanup-workflow` (should be auto-deleted)
- Expected: Automatic deletion by cleanup-merged-branches.yml
- Protected: develop, main, staging should remain safe

**Previous Results:**
- ❌ `test-branch-deletion`: Deleted by GitHub's auto-delete setting
- ✅ `test-auto-delete-disabled`: Preserved when auto-delete disabled
- ❌ `develop`: Was deleted (when auto-delete was ON)
- ✅ `develop`: Now protected (after auto-delete disabled)

**This confirms the new workflow handles cleanup safely.**
