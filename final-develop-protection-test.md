# Final Develop Protection Test

**ISSUE RESOLVED!** ✅

The root cause has been identified and fixed:
- **Problem**: "Automatically delete head branches" was overriding branch protection rules
- **Solution**: Disabled "Automatically delete head branches"
- **Verification**: Regular branch `test-auto-delete-disabled` was preserved after merge

**This Final Test:**
- Branch: `develop` (protected)
- Setting: Auto-delete now DISABLED
- Expected: develop branch should remain protected
- Confidence: HIGH (issue resolved)

**Benefits of This Solution:**
- ✅ Protected branches (develop, staging) are truly protected
- ✅ Feature branches still get cleaned up manually when needed
- ✅ No bypass of security rules
- ✅ Maintains proper branch strategy
